//The Story: We want an app that once it measures a kid's height, can display whether the child 
//is tall enough to ride the rollercoaster. We're tasked with building the function that will display 
//the right message to the child.

//Step 1: Review and edit your variables as needed
//Are your variables accurate? Update them if need be.

//Step 2: Create a conditional where:
//If the rider's height is greater than 52, the console.log should say "Get on that ride, kiddo!". Otherwise, console.
//log should say "Sorry kiddo. Maybe next year."

Function Get on that ride kiddo(getting on the ride) {
    if (childIs52Inches.theyCangetOn == true)
    if (childIs52InchestheyCangetOn = false)
}
else { ifchildIs52Inches.theyCangetOn =true;  }
