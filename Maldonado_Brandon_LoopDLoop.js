//A local fitness coach and mechanical engineer is building an IoT device that pops out a piece of candy
//every time a runner reaches 2 miles on a treadmill but stops giving candy out at mile 6. 
//We're tasked with building the loop functionality to know when to give a piece of candy and when to stop.


//Step 1: Using comments in your VS Code, answer the following questions: 

//How do we know we need a loop here? 
// We need a loop for the service of the treadmill. 

//What's the starting point of the loop? mile 1
//When should the loop stop? after mile 6.
//How will it know to stop?
//What's the incrementing for each iteration of the loop?
//What variables do we need?
//NOTE --> the above list of questions is a great tool to help you break down building a loop. Moving forward, 
//you will be expected to know to ask those questions on your own. 

//Step 2: Build out the loop.

//Step 3: Save and submit.

for (var e = 0 <= 6;e++) {console.log(e);}
